# TAMUhack 2020

This project is designed for the ground crew at airports. When a passenger has a very tight connection (<30minutes) it is sometimes possible for the passenger to make the connection while their luggage does not get transferred in time. This project seeks to display bags to the ground crew prioritized by shortest connection time, so that the amount of luggage that does not make tight connections is minimized.

The frontend was built here using React (bootstrapped with CRA) and the backend was made using the American Airlines [Flight Engine](https://github.com/tdextrous/Flight-Engine) repository. For our use case, some modifications were necessary to Flight Engine so we are using a fork. These changes have been submitted as a PR on the original repository.
